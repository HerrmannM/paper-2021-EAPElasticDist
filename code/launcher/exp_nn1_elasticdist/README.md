# Important information about the results

The results and figures folders contain a "pre revision" zip file.
This results are the one originally submitted.
After the reviewers rightfully pointed out that our comparison [exp_nn1_dtw_kb](../exp_nn1_dtw_lb)
needed to include the result from PrunedDTW and its 2018 revision, we launched a full batch of experiments.
Even though we used the same cluster, this lead to small (but inconsequential) variations.
This variations only impact the result for DTW and CDTW in their base, eabase, pruned, and eap versions.

To keep all the graphs in sync, we updated the results with the latest timings, 
and kept the former resulting for acocuntability.
