    /** Constrained Dynamic Time Warping with cutoff point for early abandoning and pruning.
     *  Double buffered implementation using O(n) space.
     *  Worst case scenario has a O(nÂ²) time complexity (no pruning nor early abandoning, large window).
     *  A tight cutoff can allow a lot of pruning, speeding up the process considerably.
     *  Actual implementation assuming that some pre-conditions are fulfilled.
     * @param lines     Pointer to the "line series". Must be the longest series. Cannot be null.
     * @param nblines   Length of the line series. Must be 0 < nbcols <= nblines < tempo::MAX_SERIES_LENGTH.
     * @param cols      Pointer to the "column series". Must be the shortest series. Cannot be null.
     * @param nbcols    Length of the column series. Must be 0 < nbcols <= nblines < tempo::MAX_SERIES_LENGTH.
     * @param w         Half-window parameter (looking at w cells on each side of the diagonal)
     *                  Must be 0<=w<=nblines and nblines - nbcols <= w
     * @param cutoff.   Attempt to prune computation of alignments with cost > cutoff.
     *                  May lead to early abandoning.
     * @return CDTW between the two series or +INF if early abandoned or, given w, no alignment is possible.
